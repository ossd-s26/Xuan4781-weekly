### Git Exercises

This week’s Git exercises helped me understand Git a lot better. I already knew Git to a decent level, but I usually don’t use commands like git log to check history. It showed me there’s a lot more I can do with Git, especially for tracking changes and understanding what’s happening in a repository. It made me feel more confident using Git beyond just add, commit, and push.

### Project Evaluations

I looked at a few projects that other students evaluated. Some looked easier to contribute to because they had clear instructions and easier installation setup. Others seemed more complicated and harder to understand at first, like Brave, which is a browser. There’s so much you can contribute to, but the installation process alone can take up to an hour.

It made me realize that good documentation makes a huge difference. Projects that explain things well feel way less intimidating.

I’m excited to contribute to real projects that people actually use. It feels more meaningful than just doing assignments.

The biggest challenge will probably be understanding large codebases and knowing where to start. My plan is to start small, read the documentation, and look for beginner issues, especially in the wiki.
