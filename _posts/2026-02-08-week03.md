### Team Brown 

For our meeting, my team had multiple ideas. The current one we have decided on is a drop-down slider for social media tabs. For example, if a user had two tabs open in their browser—one being Brightspace and the other Discord—imagine being on Brightspace and hovering over the upper-right corner of the screen to have a tiny Discord window slide down where you could chat and communicate. The window would preferably be around 200px wide and half the height of the screen on the right side. It's like a phone display in the top right when you hover above. This idea came to mind first because, for people like me who hate switching between tabs or applications that take up the full screen, it would be really handy to declutter my desktop.

### Scope? 

This might be a very complicated project, so I think our team might have to scope it down. There are only three people on the team, but we haven’t run into any major issues so far. For collaboration, I’m well-versed in GitHub and handle JavaScript fairly well. However, I have never made a Chrome extension and am not sure if this project would allow us to manipulate different tabs and screen formats effectively. My biggest contribution so far has been initiating ideas and making small edits to our repository. During this activity, I also learned that I have quite a few pet peeves. We'll see how this goes!
